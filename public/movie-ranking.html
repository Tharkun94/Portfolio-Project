            <h3 style="color:crimson;">Lord of the Rings</h3>
        <p>Honestly my favorite movies ever. Beautful story with high stakes and rich emotional moments</p>
        <h3 style="color:gold;">Star Wars</h3>
        <p>When i am not geeking out about Lord of The Rings, I am likely geeking out about Star Wars. The universe itself is a fantastic place to get lost in, but not all of the movies are home runs. However that is neither here nor there</p>
        <h3>Godzilla</h3>
        <p>Truly a guilty pleasure. A long series about a big, nuclear lizard who is virtually indusctructable. What's not to love?</p>
